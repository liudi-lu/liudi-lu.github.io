The aim of this thesis is to better understand how different factors affect microalgal growth.

In a third part, we show how the shape of the topography affects (or not) the algal growth in raceway ponds. In this way, we consider a hydrodynamical-biological coupled model and introduce an optimization problem associated with the topography to maximize the algal growth.
