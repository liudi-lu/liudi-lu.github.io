abstract = {Dynamic light regimes strongly impact microalgal photosynthesis efficiency. Finding the optimal way to supply light is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by overexposition to light and, at the same time, there is a lack of light in the deepest part of the culture. In this paper, we use the Han model to study the theoretical microalgal growth rate by applying periodically two different light intensities. Two approaches are considered depending on the period of the light pattern. For a large light period, we demonstrate that the average photosynthetic rate can be improved under some conditions. Moreover, we can also enhance the growth rate at steady state as given by the PI-curve. Although, these conditions change through the depth of a bioreactor. This theoretical improvement in the range of 10â€“15% is due to a recovery of photoinhibited cells during the high irradiance phase. We give a minimal value of the duty cycle for which the optimal irradiance is perceived by the algae culture under flashing light regime.}
