We examined four existing descriptions of the Haldane model in the literature, and introduced an additional description based on only two parameters. We investigated the interrelations among these five descriptions in the context of photoinhibited microalgae growth rate. Using state-of-the-art model identification technique, we carried out sensitivity analyses on each parameter across all descriptions. Furthermore, we introduced a novel criterion to account for the model accuracy in the selection of the most suitable description. Using experimental data from literature on response to irradiance, we determined the parameter values for each description and for each data set. The correlation between each parameter is discussed. When parameters within a description exhibit strong correlations, they convey similar information, rendering the description less efficient. The sensitivity analysis, combined with an upgrade of the Akaike information criterion (AICc) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), identified our two-parameter description as the optimal choice for representing microalgae growth rate in response to irradiance variations. Importantly, the novel information criterion, namely PEMAC, outperforms traditional criteria such as AICc and BIC in distinguishing between equivalent descriptions. This work illustrates the hidden complexity in inhibition models and end up with a wise recommendation for the modelling of inhibition: 'Keep It Simple (KIS)'.","tags":["Haldane model","microalgae","parameter identification","sensitivity analysis","AIC","BIC"],"title":"Representing inhibition in growth kinetics: the Haldane KIS","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1710460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710460800,"objectID":"74e0184f01982fba0d9b9326322cbd08","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/time-domain-decomposition-methods-for-parabolic-optimal-control-problems/","publishdate":"2023-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/time-domain-decomposition-methods-for-parabolic-optimal-control-problems/","section":"event","summary":"We present new algorithms with a time domain decomposition applied to unconstrained parabolic optimal control problems.

At lower intensity, the microalgae are photolimited, since the amount of photons they received is not enough to optimally trigger the photosynthetic machinery. On the other hand, higher intensity induces damage in key proteins within the photosynthetic center of the cells. Due to the mixing in the photobioreactor, which creates a strong light gradient, the growth of the cells is affected by their light exposure history, which results from the hydrodynamics of the photobioreactor. We use the mechanistic model of Han to capture both photoinhibition and photolimitation. First, we compute the time-averaged growth rate for arbitrary continuous light signals. Our analysis reveals how mixing influences the average growth rate, assuming that hydrodynamics generate periodic light signals. Then, we tackle the challenge of computing the growth rate in photobioreactors simulated through computational fluid dynamics, considering a single-phase incompressible fluid.

Since their emergence and the seminal work of Pierre-Louis Lions, they have received a considerable amount of attention. Their study, whether it is conducted at the continuous level or the discrete level, remains a challenging issue. This mini-symposium aims at gathering experts on the subject, present- ing recent advancements in transmission conditions in DDMs, and focusing on their application for solving efficiently PDE-constrained optimization problems.

The aim of our current study is to investigate theoretically the impact of bottom topography in raceway ponds on microalgae growth. To achieve this goal, we consider a biological model (based on the Han model) coupled with the Saint-Venant systems that model the fluid into the raceway pond. In particular, we focus on the laminar region of the fluid, far from the paddle wheel, and investigate how different topographies may influence the growth rate of microalgae. This consideration enables us to formulate an optimization problem, for which we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to identify the optimal topographies that maximize the biomass production over one lap of the raceway pond or multiple laps with a paddle wheel. On the contrary to a widespread belief in the microalgae field, the results show that a flat topography is optimal in a periodic regime. However, non-trivial topographies may be more advantageous in alternative scenarios, such as when considering the effects of mixing devices within the model. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between bottom topography, fluid dynamics, and microalgae growth in raceway ponds, offering valuable insights into optimizing biomass production.","tags":["optimal control","PMP","shape optimization","Han model","Saint-Venant system","microalgae","raceway pond"],"title":"Topography optimization for enhancing Microalgal growth in raceway ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastien Chaudet-Dumas","Liu-Di Lu","Lucas Perrin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684108800,"objectID":"45f217d371c621eb9d0b0f5437ab49fb","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/research-school-impde2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/research-school-impde2023/","section":"event","summary":"This research school, which is exclusively dedicated to young researchers (PhD students, post-docs...), focuses on this research topic.

Finding the optimal way to supply light is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by overexposition to light and, at the same time, there is a lack of light in the deepest part of the culture. In this paper, we use the Han model to study the theoretical microalgal growth rate by applying periodically two different light intensities. Two approaches are considered depending on the period of the light pattern. For a large light period, we demonstrate that the average photosynthetic rate can be improved under some conditions. Moreover, we can also enhance the growth rate at steady state as given by the PI-curve. Although, these conditions change through the depth of a bioreactor. This theoretical improvement in the range of 10–15% is due to a recovery of photoinhibited cells during the high irradiance phase. We give a minimal value of the duty cycle for which the optimal irradiance is perceived by the algae culture under flashing light regime.","tags":["microalgae","flashing light","growth rate","Han model"],"title":"Theoretical growth rate under high/low-flashing light","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661126400,"objectID":"59b72a4d7812f9ec9773c4d2c8f2c8a4","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/multigrid-method-for-optimal-control-problem/","publishdate":"2022-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/multigrid-method-for-optimal-control-problem/","section":"event","summary":"In this talk, we will present Multigrid Methods applied to optimal control problems arising from parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs).

More precisely, we consider a system with $N$ resources and $N$ activities, each activity use the allocated resource to evolve up to a given time $T  0$ where a control (represented by a given permutation) will be applied on the system to re-allocate the resources. The goal is to find the optimal control strategies which optimize the cost or the benefit of the system. This problem can be illustrated by an industrial biological application, namely the optimization of a mixing strategy to enhance the growth rate in a microalgal raceway system. A mixing device, such as a paddle wheel, is considered to control the rearrangement of the depth of the algae cultures hence the light perceived at each lap. We prove that if the dynamics of the system is periodic, then the period corresponds to one re-allocation whatever the order of the involved permutation matrix is. A nonlinear optimization problem for one re-allocation process is then introduced. Since $N!$ permutations need to be tested in the general case, it can be numerically solved only for a limited number of $N$. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a second optimization problem which provides a suboptimal solution of the initial problem, but whose solution can be determined explicitly. A sufficient condition to characterize cases where the two problems have the same solution is given. Some numerical experiments are performed to assess the benefit of optimal strategies in various settings.","tags":["resource allocation","nonlinear problems","periodic control","dynamical system","microalgae production","periodic system","impulse control","switched systems","permutation","linear approximation","assignment problem"],"title":"Optimal periodic resource allocation in reactive dynamical systems: application to Microalgal production","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649808e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649808e3,"objectID":"b6601f25bf3b8ddb566e9267f7ef16e1","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/domain-decomposition-methods-and-applications-for-optimal-control-problems/","publishdate":"2022-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/domain-decomposition-methods-and-applications-for-optimal-control-problems/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Domain Decomposition Methods and Applications for Optimal Control Problems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Olivier Bernard","Liu-Di Lu"],"categories":["microalgae"],"content":"","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647993600,"objectID":"e9444df846c00b12969f17ba6251ded2","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/publication/article-jpc/","publishdate":"2021-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-jpc/","section":"publication","summary":"The potential of industrial applications for microalgae has motivated their recent fast development. Their growth dynamics depends on different factors that must be optimized. Since they get their energy from photosynthesis, light is a key factor that strongly influences their productivity. Light is absorbed and scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases towards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate non-linearly depending on the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light. Productivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is distributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate and the background turbidity. We propose a theoretical analysis of this problem, by introducing the concept of optical depth productivity for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for. A global optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of the compensation condition, consisting in compensating the algal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This condition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity depending on the minimum reachable depth. We develop a nonlinear controller and prove the global asymptotic stability of the biomass concentration towards the desired optimal value.","tags":["photobioreactor","optimization","nonlinear adaptive control","microalgae","light extinction","compensation condition","turbidostat"],"title":"Optimal optical conditions for Microalgal production in photobioreactors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642982400,"objectID":"ad4b1d10f734c72284744fe58956da3c","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/some-modelling-and-optimization-problems-for-microalgal-raceway-ponds/","publishdate":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/some-modelling-and-optimization-problems-for-microalgal-raceway-ponds/","section":"event","summary":"Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms whose potential has been highlighted in the last decade, especially for food, renewable energy and wastewater treatment.

Applications can be found from to renewable energy production and wastewater treatment to some high added value commercial products e.g., food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics. Nevertheless, finding optimal growth conditions for full-scale cultivation of microalgae remains challenging in practice. Mathematical models are therefore of great help to better manage this complex, nonlinear dynamical system. The aim of this thesis is to better understand how different factors affect microalgal growth. In a first part, we study the influence of the light attenuation and the optimal condition to maximize the productivity. In this way, we introduce an optical productivity which enables us to determine the optimal condition for general light extinction function. A global optimal optical depth is found which consists in canceling the algal net growth rate at the bottom of the reactors to maximize the optical productivity. It can be used to characterize the optimization of the areal productivity in some specific cases, whereas an asymptotic behaviour has been observed in more general case. We then limit ourselves to a specific reactor - the raceway pond, which is an outdoor circuit basin combining with a paddle wheel. We start by investigating a resource allocation problem issuing from the re-distribution of the light resource to the algae by the paddle wheel. A generic mixing device is considered to assign at each lap the light resource to the algae layers in the raceway. We determine the optimal allocation strategies to maximize the algal growth. In a third part, we show how the shape of the topography affects (or not) the algal growth in raceway ponds. In this way, we consider a hydrodynamical-biological coupled model and introduce an optimization problem associated with the topography to maximize the algal growth. We also combine the optimization of the topographies with the previous allocation strategies to investigate their influence on algal production. Non-trivial topographies are obtained numerically to enhance the algal growth. The mathematical study of these optimization problems leads to new interesting working directions, improves and clarifies the understanding of influence by different factors on algal growth. We conclude with some discussions and perspectives of this work.","tags":["optimization","mathematical modelling","hydrodynamics","dynamical system","resource allocation","periodic control","nonlinear control","Saint-Venant equations","Han Model","microalgae"],"title":"Lagrangian Approaches for Modelling and Optimization of Hydrodynamic-Photosynthesis Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623542400,"objectID":"e2ada90482110a152350204f1a91ac69","permalink":"https://liudi-lu.github.io/talk/mixing-strategies-combined-with-shape-design-to-enhance-productivity-of-a-raceway-pond/","publishdate":"2020-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mixing-strategies-combined-with-shape-design-to-enhance-productivity-of-a-raceway-pond/","section":"event","summary":"This paper focuses on mixing strategies and designing shape of the bottom topographies to enhance the growth of the microalgae in raceway ponds.

L'idée essentielle est de représenter les solutions des équations par une combinaison linéaire de certaines solutions associées à des jeux de paramètres bien choisis, et qui sont calculées une fois pour toutes dans une phase de pré-calcul. Il est connu que cette méthode ne fonctionne pas pour des équations de transport (même linéaires), puisque la dimension de Kolmogorov est alors très grande. Cette présentation commence par quelques notions basiques de RB et puis propose une approche spécifique pour l'équation de Burgers.","tags":null,"title":"Model Reduction for Burgers Equation","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
