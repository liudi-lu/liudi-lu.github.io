More precisely, we consider a system with $N$ resources and $N$ activities, each activity use the allocated resource to evolve up to a given time $T  0$ where a control (represented by a given permutation) will be applied on the system to re-allocate the resources. The goal is to find the optimal control strategies which optimize the cost or the benefit of the system. This problem can be illustrated by an industrial biological application, namely the optimization of a mixing strategy to enhance the growth rate in a microalgal raceway system. A mixing device, such as a paddle wheel, is considered to control the rearrangement of the depth of the algae cultures hence the light perceived at each lap. We prove that if the dynamics of the system is periodic, then the period corresponds to one re-allocation whatever the order of the involved permutation matrix is. A nonlinear op- timization problem for one re-allocation process is then introduced. Since $N!$ permutations need to be tested in the general case, it can be numerically solved only for a limited number of $N$. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a second optimization problem which provides a subopti- mal solution of the initial problem, but whose solution can be determined explicitly. A sufficient condition to characterize cases where the two prob- lems have the same solution is given. Some numerical experiments are performed to assess the benefit of optimal strategies in various settings.","tags":["Resource Allocation","Nonlinear Problems","Periodic Control","Dynamical System","Microalgae production","Periodic System","Impulse Control","Switched Systems","Permutation","Linear Approximation","Assignment Problem."],"title":"Optimal periodic resource allocation in reactive dynamical systems: application to Microalgal production","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649808000,"objectID":"18f7024af8e6f049ed3f939bab82636d","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/domain-decomposition-methods-and-applications-for-optimal-control-problems/","publishdate":"2022-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/domain-decomposition-methods-and-applications-for-optimal-control-problems/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Domain Decomposition Methods and Applications for Optimal Control Problems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Olivier Bernard","Liu-Di LU"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647993600,"objectID":"e9444df846c00b12969f17ba6251ded2","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/article-jpc/","publishdate":"2021-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-jpc/","section":"publication","summary":"The potential of industrial applications for microalgae has motivated their recent fast development. Their growth dynamics depends on different factors that must be optimized. Since they get their energy from photosynthesis, light is a key factor that strongly influences their productivity. Light is absorbed and scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases towards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate non-linearly depending on the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light. Productivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is distributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate and the background turbidity. We propose a theoretical analysis of this problem, by introducing the concept of optical depth productivity for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for. A global optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of the compensation condition, consisting in compensating the algal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This condition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity depending on the minimum reachable depth. We develop a nonlinear controller and prove the global asymptotic stability of the biomass concentration towards the desired optimal value.","tags":["Photobioreactor","Optimization","Nonlinear adaptive control","Microalgae","Light extinction","Compensation condition","Turbidostat"],"title":"Optimal optical conditions for Microalgal production in photobioreactors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642982400,"objectID":"2819a511154eb588f00cb396ef9e9bb6","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/some-modelling-and-optimization-problems-for-microalgal-raceway-ponds/","publishdate":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/some-modelling-and-optimization-problems-for-microalgal-raceway-ponds/","section":"event","summary":"Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms whose potential has been highlighted in the last decade, especially for food, renewable energy and wastewater treatment.

Low light in the reactors leads to limited growth of the algae, whereas strong light may induce the damage to the photosynthetic reaction center, hence reduce the growth. Finding the optimal light regime is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by being overexposed to the light. In this paper, we study the theoretical microalgal growth rate using the Han model under the high/low flashing light regime, i.e. when two different light intensities are applied. Two approaches were considered depending on the period of the light pattern. For a large light period we show that, under some conditions we can improve the average growth rate and get greater values than the ones that the PI-curve can achieve in the Han model. Although, These conditions change through the depth of a bioreactor. This theoretical improvement is due to a recover of photodamaged cells during the high light intensity phase. Considering flashing light, we give a minimal value of the duty cycle for which the optimal light intensity is perceived by the algae culture, we also give the value of the depth in which the algae perceives this optical light intensity.","tags":["Microalgae","Flashing light","Growth rate","Han model"],"title":"Theoretical growth rate under high/low-flashing light","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635811200,"objectID":"a6430bb954cd64d3a88276916dd44187","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/microalgal-raceway-ponds-modelling-and-optimization-problems/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/microalgal-raceway-ponds-modelling-and-optimization-problems/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Microalgal raceway ponds modelling and optimization problems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Liu-Di LU"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632873600,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2021-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Microalgae are photosynthetic micro-organisms whose potential has been highlighted in the last decade. Applications can be found from to renewable energy production and wastewater treatment to some high added value commercial products e.g., food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics. Nevertheless, finding optimal growth conditions for full-scale cultivation of microalgae remains challenging in practice. Mathematical models are therefore of great help to better manage this complex, nonlinear dynamical system. The aim of this thesis is to better understand how different factors affect microalgal growth. In a first part, we study the influence of the light attenuation and the optimal condition to maximize the productivity. In this way, we introduce an optical productivity which enables us to determine the optimal condition for general light extinction function. A global optimal optical depth is found which consists in canceling the algal net growth rate at the bottom of the reactors to maximize the optical productivity. It can be used to characterize the optimization of the areal productivity in some specific cases, whereas an asymptotic behaviour has been observed in more general case. We then limit ourselves to a specific reactor - the raceway pond, which is an outdoor circuit basin combining with a paddle wheel. We start by investigating a resource allocation problem issuing from the re-distribution of the light resource to the algae by the paddle wheel. A generic mixing device is considered to assign at each lap the light resource to the algae layers in the raceway. We determine the optimal allocation strategies to maximize the algal growth. In a third part, we show how the shape of the topography affects (or not) the algal growth in raceway ponds. In this way, we consider a hydrodynamical-biological coupled model and introduce an optimization problem associated with the topography to maximize the algal growth. We also combine the optimization of the topographies with the previous allocation strategies to investigate their influence on algal production. Non-trivial topographies are obtained numerically to enhance the algal growth. The mathematical study of these optimization problems leads to new interesting working directions, improves and clarifies the understanding of influence by different factors on algal growth. We conclude with some discussions and perspectives of this work.","tags":["Optimization","Mathematical Modelling","Hydrodynamics","Dynamical System","Resource Allocation","Periodic Control","Nonlinear Control","Saint-Venant Equations","Han Model","Microalgae"],"title":"Lagrangian Approaches for Modelling and Optimization of Hydrodynamic-Photosynthesis Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623542400,"objectID":"6bfefa036f514ab7d7b2a60a59d7feca","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/mixing-strategies-combined-with-shape-design-to-enhance-productivity-of-a-raceway-pond/","publishdate":"2020-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mixing-strategies-combined-with-shape-design-to-enhance-productivity-of-a-raceway-pond/","section":"event","summary":"This paper focuses on mixing strategies and designing shape of the bottom topographies to enhance the growth of the microalgae in raceway ponds.

In this talk, we focus on the cultivation of algae in a raceway pond, where a paddle wheel is considered to set in motion the water and mix the microalgae (D. Demory et al. How do microalgae perceive light in a high-rate pond? Towards more realistic Lagrangian experiments, The Royal Society, 2018). We consider a coupled physical-biological-mixing model describing the growth of microalgae in raceway ponds cultivation process. Our approach combines a biological model (based on the Han model), shallow water dynamics equations that model the fluid in the raceway pond and a permutation matrix which models a mixing device to exchange the algae layers at each new lap. We present an adjoint-based optimization procedure which includes the constraints associated to the shallow water regime. This approach enables us to deal with the topography and the mixing strategies to maximize the biomass production. On the contrary to a widespread belief, we show that a flat topography is the optimal in a periodic regime with no mixing strategy. However, non trivial topographies can be obtained associated with some specific mixing strategies (O. Bernard et al. Shape optimization of a microalgal raceway to enhance productivity, Preprint, 2020). We prove that whatever the order of the considered permutation is, the periodic system have a period corresponding to one lap (O. Bernard et al. Optimizing microalgal productivity in raceway ponds through a controlled mixing device, Preprint, 2020). The numerical results show that though non-flat topographies may slightly enhance the production, an appropriate mixing strategies can improve it significantly.","tags":null,"title":"Optimization problem for a microalgal raceway pond to enhance productivity","type":"event"},{"authors":["Olivier Bernard","Liu-Di LU","Jacques Sainte-Marie","Julien Salomon"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604793600,"objectID":"831680f55b21b64d865b5dfc85571954","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/article-automatica/","publishdate":"2020-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-automatica/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a coupled hydrodynamical-biological model describing growth in a microalgal raceway pond cultivation. More precisely, our approach combines a biological model (based on the Han model) and Saint-Venant systems that model the fluid into the raceway pond. Here we focus on the laminar fraction of the fluid, far from the paddle wheel, considering different topographies to enhance the microalgal growth rate. We present an optimization problem derived from the Pontryagin Maximum Principle dealing with the topography to maximize the biomass production over one lap or multiple laps with a paddle wheel. On the contrary to a widespread belief in the microalgae field, the results show that a flat topography is optimal in a periodic regime. In other frameworks, non-trivial topographies can be obtained. We present some of them, e.g., when the mixing device is also taken into account in the model.","tags":["Optimal control","PMP","Shape optimization","Han model","Saint-Venant system","Microalgal raceway"],"title":"Topography optimization for enhancing Microalgal growth in raceway ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604448000,"objectID":"12162191765244235e17799ddba5b057","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/optimization-problems-of-a-microalgal-raceway-to-enhance-productivity/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/optimization-problems-of-a-microalgal-raceway-to-enhance-productivity/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Optimization problems of a microalgal raceway to enhance productivity","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559001600,"objectID":"cd097b6119200154d23663ad37ae9841","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/model-reduction-for-burgers-equation/","publishdate":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/model-reduction-for-burgers-equation/","section":"event","summary":"La méthode des bases réduites (RB) nous permet de fournir des approximations rapides et fiables pour des EDPs paramétriques, au moins dans le cas où l'épaisseur de Kolmogorov de l'ensemble des solutions obtenues lorsque les paramètres varient est faible. L'idée essentielle est de représenter les solutions des équations par une combinaison linéaire de certaines solutions associées à des jeux de paramètres bien choisis, et qui sont calculées une fois pour toutes dans une phase de pré-calcul. Il est connu que cette méthode ne fonctionne pas pour des équations de transport (même linéaires), puisque la dimension de Kolmogorov est alors très grande. Cette présentation commence par quelques notions basiques de RB et puis propose une approche spécifique pour l'équation de Burgers.","tags":null,"title":"Model Reduction for Burgers Equation","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
