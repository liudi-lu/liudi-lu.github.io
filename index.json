Low light in the reactors leads to limited growth of the algae, whereas strong light may induce the damage to the photosynthetic reaction center, hence reduce the growth. Finding the optimal light regime is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by being overexposed to the light. In this paper, we study the theoretical microalgal growth rate using the Han model under the high/low flashing light regime, i.e. when two different light intensities are applied. Two approaches were considered depending on the period of the light pattern. For a large light period we show that, under some conditions we can improve the average growth rate and get greater values than the ones that the PI-curve can achieve in the Han model. Although, These conditions change through the depth of a bioreactor. This theoretical improvement is due to a recover of photodamaged cells during the high light intensity phase. Considering flashing light, we give a minimal value of the duty cycle for which the optimal light intensity is perceived by the algae culture, we also give the value of the depth in which the algae perceives this optical light intensity.","tags":[],"title":"Theoretical growth rate under high/low-flashing light","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivier Bernard","Liu-Di LU"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1629480103,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629480103,"objectID":"93663a493fa1db47c3c560b5291b2ba0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/article-optical/","publishdate":"2021-08-20T18:21:43+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/article-optical/","section":"publication","summary":"The potential of industrial applications for microalgae has motivated their recent fast development. Their growth dynamics depends on different factors that must be optimized. Since they get their energy from photosynthesis, light is a key factor that strongly influences their productivity. Light is absorbed and scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases towards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate nonlinearly depending on the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem, especially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light. Productivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is distributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate and the background turbidity. The concept of optical depth productivity is introduced for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for and a global optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of the compensation condition. This optimal condition consists in compensating the algal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This condition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity depending on the minimum reachable depth. We develop a nonlinear controller and prove the global asymptotic stability of the biomass concentration towards the desired optimal value.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal optical conditions for Microalgal production in photobioreactors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivier Bernard","Liu-Di LU","Julien Salomon"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1623604903,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623604903,"objectID":"e54399fc8bfdddd45aeec7b8a14dfa0a","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/adchem21/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T18:21:43+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/adchem21/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper focuses on mixing strategies and designing shape of the bottom topographies to enhance the growth of the microalgae in raceway ponds.

More precisely, we consider a system with $N$ resources and $N$ activities, each activity use the allocated resource to evolve up to a given time $T0$ where a control (represented by a given permutation) will be applied on the system to re-allocate the resources. The goal is to find the optimal control strategies which optimize the cost or the benefit of the system. This problem can be illustrated by an industrial biological application, namely the optimization of a mixing strategy to enhance the growth rate in a microalgal raceway system. A mixing device, such as a paddle wheel, is considered to control the rearrangement of the depth of the algae cultures hence the light perceived at each lap. We prove that if the dynamics of the system is periodic, then the period corresponds to one re-allocation whatever the order of the involved permutation matrix is. A nonlinear optimization problem for one re-allocation process is then introduced. Since $N!$ permutations need to be tested in the general case, it can be numerically solved only for a limited number of $N$. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a second optimization problem which provides a suboptimal solution of the initial problem, but whose solution can be determined explicitly. A sufficient condition to characterize cases where the two problems have the same solution is given. Some numerical experiments are performed to assess the benefit of optimal strategies in various settings.","tags":[],"title":"Optimization of mixing strategy in microalgal raceway ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liu-Di LU","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
